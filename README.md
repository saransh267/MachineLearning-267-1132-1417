Classification of stars and quasars using KNN


Using Machine Learning to classify stars and quasars from data obtained from Galex and SDSS photometric data. We used the K-nearest neighbors approach do this task. We measured the correctness for this by accuracy and other parameters such as precision, recall and F1 score.
